# Pokémon TCG Collecting Guide

## Basic Terminology

- **TCG**: Trading Card Game
- **Set**: A collection of cards released together under a theme
- **Expansion**: Another term for a set
- **Pull**: The rare card(s) you get from opening packs
- **Pull Rate**: The likelihood of getting certain rare cards from packs
- **Chase Card**: A highly desirable card that people specifically try to collect
- **Rotation**: When older sets become ineligible for standard competitive play

## Product Types

### Booster Packs
- Individual packs containing 10 random cards
- Usually priced around £3-4 each
- Most affordable entry point but highest cost per card
- Prone to tampering when sold individually

### Booster Boxes
- Contains 36 booster packs
- MSRP is £143, though market prices are currently higher due to high demand
- Best value for opening large quantities of packs
- **Important**: Regular expansion sets have booster boxes, but specialty sets typically do not. If someone claims to sell a booster box of a specialty set, it's likely a scam.

### Booster Bundles
- Contains 6 booster packs bundled together
- Usually priced around £20-30
- Better value than individual packs, more accessible than booster boxes
- Less likely to be tampered with than individual packs

### Elite Trainer Boxes (ETBs)
- Standard ETBs contain 9 booster packs and retail for about £45 MSRP
- Pokémon Center exclusive ETBs contain 11 packs and retail for about £55 MSRP
- Both include a promo card, sleeves, dice, condition markers, and a storage box
- **Contains a guide book with images of all cards in the set** - very helpful for collectors
- Pokémon Center ETBs include a second version of the promo card with a Pokémon Center stamp, significantly increasing its value
- Good middle-ground option between single packs and booster boxes

### Theme Decks / Battle Academy
- Pre-constructed 60-card decks ready to play
- Good for beginners wanting to play the game
- Usually £12-25 depending on the product
- Not ideal for collectors seeking rare cards

### Special Collection Boxes
- Contains specific promo cards plus a few booster packs
- Price varies widely (£15-60+) depending on contents
- Often themed around specific Pokémon

### Blister Packs/3-Pack Blisters
- Sealed product containing 1-3 booster packs and sometimes a promo card
- Less susceptible to tampering than loose packs
- Good option for buying small quantities

## Card Rarities

### Standard Rarities
- **Common (●)**: Most abundant cards in packs, usually basic Pokémon or simple Trainer cards
- **Uncommon (●●)**: Less abundant than Commons but not particularly rare
- **Rare (★)**: Basic rare card, typically one per pack
- **Reverse Holo**: Common, Uncommon, or Rare cards with a holographic pattern on the card's border/background rather than the illustration

### Special Rarities
- **Double Rare**: Denoted by two stars (★★), more valuable than standard Rares
- **Ace Spec Rare**: Special Trainer cards with powerful effects, limited to one per deck in competitive play
- **Illustration Rare (IR)**: Cards with unique, artistic renditions of Pokémon that extend across more of the card
- **Ultra Rare**: High-value cards including Pokémon ex, VMAX, VSTAR, etc.
- **Special Illustration Rare (SIR)**: Premium artistic cards with unique illustrations and texturing
- **Hyper Rare**: Extremely rare cards featuring rainbow holographic patterns, also called Rainbow Rare

## Current Market Conditions

- The hobby is currently experiencing high demand, leading to availability issues
- Scalpers have made buying products at MSRP very difficult
- The Pokémon Company has announced plans to increase production to meet demand
- Based on historical patterns, supply issues likely won't be resolved until late 2025
- It may be better to wait for market stabilization before heavily investing in collecting

## Set Structure and Popularity

### Scarlet & Violet Era Sets

#### Base Sets
- **Scarlet & Violet Base Set**
  - First set introducing the Paldea region Pokémon
  - Featured Pokémon ex as the new mechanic, replacing V cards

#### Popular/Premium Sets
- **Pokémon 151**
  - Specialty set featuring all 151 original Pokémon
  - Extremely popular due to nostalgia factor of first-generation Pokémon
  - ETBs cost around £150 on the secondary market (well above MSRP)
  - Does not have booster boxes (as it's a specialty set)
  
- **Prismatic Evolutions**
  - Specialty set focused on Eevee and its evolutions (Eeveelutions)
  - Known for poor pull rates, making it risky for opening
  - Secondary market prices are high (around £100 for an ETB)
  - Features rare "God packs" containing all Eeveelution special illustration rares in a single pack
  - Not recommended for budget collectors due to high cost and low pull rates

#### Upcoming Sets
- **Destined Rivals**
  - Upcoming set focused on Team Rocket
  - Team Rocket is a villainous organization from the original games and anime, known for stealing Pokémon and causing trouble
  - Highly anticipated due to nostalgia - Team Rocket (particularly Jesse, James, and their Pokémon Meowth) are iconic characters from the early days of Pokémon
  - Expected to be difficult to obtain at release
  - Likely to appeal to older collectors who remember the original Team Rocket set from the late 1990s/early 2000s

## Budget-Friendly Collecting Strategies

### Maximize Your Value
- Buy booster boxes if opening many packs (best price per pack)
- Consider pre-ordering new sets before prices potentially increase
- Look for sales at major retailers (often coincide with new releases)
- Elite Trainer Boxes offer good value with included accessories

### Focus Your Collection
- Collect specific Pokémon rather than complete sets
- Collect by type (Fire, Water, etc.)
- Collect a certain card variant (all Full Arts, for example)
- Buy singles of specific cards you want rather than gambling on packs

### Storage and Protection
- Use penny sleeves for basic protection
- Use top loaders or card savers for valuable cards
- Keep cards away from direct sunlight and humidity
- Consider investing in a binder with side-loading pages for display
